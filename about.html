                    Vlad Khusid is the spiritual leader and mentor of the band, having been 
                    its director since the beginning and the Jazz teacher for many of the members.
                    Born in Baku, Azerbaijan, Vlad was a prominent Jazz musician in the Soviet Union,
                    performing with the Anatoly Kroll Big Band. After moving to Australia in 1980,
                    he became a student at the Sydney Conservatorium of Music, who along with other 
                    luminaries such as James Morrison learnt under the tutelage of Australian Jazz 
                    great Don Burrows. Vlad joined Sydney Grammar School in 1988 as the Head of Brass,
                    and became the Head of Jazz in 2000, mentoring hundreds of students. Outside of the 
                    school, Vlad is a high-profile member of the world music scene in Australia, having 
                    won two ARIA awards with Monsieur Camembert in 2002 and 2004, as well as performing at
                    the opening ceremony of the 2000 Paralympic Games in Sydney.

                    The band was founded in 2001 at Sydney Grammar School by the former headmaster Dr John Vallance with
                    Vlad Khusid at the helm as a way to keep former students of the school connected to music as they 
                    continued on with their professional lives. Since those early days, the band has grown in size, playing 
                    at venues around Australia, including the prestigious Angel Place City Recital Hall in Sydney, as well as 
                    Jazz Festivals in Wangaratta, Hobart, Darwin and Manly. The band are regulars at the Lazybones Lounge in 
                    Marrickville, and have been involved in International Jazz Day celebrations with performances at iconic
                    Sydney locations such as the State Library of New South Wales.
